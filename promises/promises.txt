so this is how promise starts;
->print script starts
->array is assesed 
->promise is sent in form of object to javascript memory an this work is done by browser. 
->loop runs and sent to globa execution context in caall stack
....once this task is compleete
->print script end 
_>promise task is sent to microtask queue; and then to call stack in global execution context.
->settimeout things are sent to callback queue from there the content is sent to callstack.
->microtask queue priority is always higher so between promises and setTimeout , promise is executed first.
